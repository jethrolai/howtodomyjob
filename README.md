# How To Do My Job
This repo contains a list of documents, notes, instructions and examples to help developers to be more productive. It's the entry point for my personal professional documentation.

Some of you will probably find the many of examples and topics are too entry-level. The information provided by this repo is for general public across all levels and not for any specific group of people.

## Examples
A list of examples can be found under _examples_ directory. Part of them are implemented as a util script for import. Other is for demonstration.
