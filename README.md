# How To Do My Job
This repo contains a list of documents, notes, instructions and examples to help developers to be more productive. It's the entry point for my personal professional documentation.

Some of you will probably find the many of examples and topics are too entry-level. The information provided by this repo is for general public across all levels and not for any specific group of people.
